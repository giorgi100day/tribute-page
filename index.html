      <h1>Ronaldo de Assis Moreira</h1>

      <p class="tribute">
        Ronaldo de Assis Moreira was born on 21 March 1980 in the city of Porto
        Alegre, the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ronaldinho's career began with the Grêmio youth squad. He made his
        senior side debut during the 1998 Copa Libertadores.[22] 1999 saw the
        emergence of the 18-year-old Ronaldinho, with 22 goals in 47 matches,
        and he put in headlining displays in derbies against Internacional, most
        notably on 20 June 1999 in the Rio Grande do Sul State Championship
        final.

        Newly elected FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta stated, "I said we
        would lead Barça to the forefront of the footballing world, and for that
        to occur we had to sign one of these three players, David Beckham,
        Thierry Henry or Ronaldinho".[36] Henry remained with Arsenal, and
        Laporta then promised to bring Beckham to the club, but following his
        transfer to Real Madrid, Barcelona entered the running for Ronaldinho
        and outbid Manchester United for his signature in a €30 million deal.

        In July 2008, Ronaldinho turned down a £25.5 million offer from
        Manchester City of the Premier League, with purported wages of £200,000
        per week on offer,[76] to join Italian Serie A giants AC Milan on a
        three-year contract thought to be worth around £5.1 million (€6.5
        million) a year, for €22.05 million plus €1.05 million bonus each season
        (€24.15 million in 2010).[77][78][79][80] With the number 10 already
        occupied by teammate Clarence Seedorf, he selected 80 as his jersey
        number.[81]

        In July 2016, Ronaldinho played for the Goa 5′s, a futsal team from Goa
        in India, together with Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Míchel Salgado, and
        Hernán Crespo as well as futsal player Falcão in the Premier Futsal
        League.[117] After two games, he left India to be an ambassador of the
        2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro.[118] He was replaced by
        Cafu.[119]
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1997, Ronaldinho was part of the first Brazilian team to win the FIFA
        U-17 World Championship, which was held in Egypt, in which his first
        goal was a penalty against Austria in the first group match, which
        Brazil won 7–0.[124] Ronaldinho finished with two goals and was awarded
        the Bronze Ball award as Brazil scored a total of 21 goals while only
        conceding 2.[124]
      </p>
      <p>
        On 24 March 2007, Ronaldinho scored twice in a 4–0 win over Chile, which
        marked his first goal since the 2005 Confederations Cup final and thus
        ended a scoreless streak that lasted nearly two years.[145] He was not
        called up for the 2007 Copa América after asking to be excused from the
        tournament due to fatigue.[146] On 18 October, he was controversially
        benched by Barcelona after he was late returning to Spain following
        Brazil's 5–0 friendly win over Ecuador. He and several Brazil players
        celebrated the win by partying through the night at a posh Rio de
        Janeiro nightclub. Ronaldinho left at 11 am the next morning, allegedly
        in the trunk of a car in order to avoid the media.[147]

        In spite of his performances at his peak, a period of dedication and
        focus which saw him named the FIFA World Player of the Year twice and
        receive the Ballon d'Or, Ronaldinho was also criticised on occasion in
        the media for his lack of discipline in training, as well as his
        hedonistic lifestyle off the pitch, which some pundits believed had an
        impact on the overall longevity of his career.[193] Referring to
        Ronaldinho as "Brazil's childlike genius who never grew up", Tim Vickery
        writes that it was the sudden death of his father at such a young age
        that may have seen Ronaldinho stop making the sacrifices needed to
        remain at the summit of the sport, with the attitude of "life is short
        and can end unexpectedly–so enjoy it while you can."[8]
